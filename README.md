### Project Overview 
In this project, I explored a songs dataset using MySQL, creating a comprehensive database with tables for albums and bands. After populating these tables, I performed detailed analysis using SQL queries, including ORDER BY, GROUP BY, joins, and wildcards, to derive insights crucial for decision-making and refine my problem-solving skills.
